3.完整新聞內文:
Russia has been working on incorporating elements of China’s Great Firewall i
nto the “Red Web”, the country’s system of internet filtering and control,
after unprecedented cyber collaboration between the countries.

A decision earlier this month to block the networking site LinkedIn in Russia
is the most visible in a series of measures to bring the internet under greate
r state control.

Legislation was announced this month that gives the Kremlin primacy over cyber
space – the exchange points, domain names and cross-border fibre-optic cables
 that make up the architecture of the internet.

In the summer, a measure known as Yarovaya’s law was introduced, which requir
es Russia’s telecoms and internet providers to store users’ data for six mon
ths and metadata for three years.

A group of Kremlin and security officials is driving the offensive against int
ernet freedoms. The government fears the web could be used to mobilise protest
ers and disseminate dangerous ideas and information and it is looking for ways
 to switch off connections in times of crisis.

The strategy is being developed in close cooperation with China after a string
 of high-level meetings in Beijing and Moscow this year. At their first cybers
ecurity forum, in April, top Chinese officials and their Russian counterparts
gathered in Moscow for the talks. Delegates included Lu Wei, the head of China
’s state internet information office, Fang Binxing, the so-called father of t
he Great Firewall and Igor Shchyogolev, President Vladimir Putin’s assistant
on internet issues and former minister of communications.

“The principal agreement to have a forum was reached by Igor Shchyogolev and
Fang Binxing at a meeting in December 2015 in Beijing,” said Denis Davydov, t
he executive director of the misleadingly named League of Safe Internet, a gov
ernment-affiliated group that has drafted internet-filtering legislation and r
ecruited teams of volunteers to patrol the web for “harmful content”.

Earlier this year, the security council secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, who was
head of the Russian Federal Security Service during Putin’s 2000-08 presidenc
y, had two meetings with Chinese politburo members on information security; an
d in June, Putin went to Beijing to sign a joint communique about cyberspace.

What the Russians want most from China is technology. Russia has no means of h
andling the vast amounts of data required by Yarovaya’s law, and it cannot re
ly on western technologies because of sanctions.

However, the Chinese are willing to lend a hand. In August it was reported tha
t Blat, the Russian telecoms equipment manufacturer, was in talks with Huawei,
 the Chinese telecoms company, to buy technologies for data storage and produc
e servers to implement Yarovaya’s law.

The Chinese officials also ensured senior Huawei staff were present at key inf
ormation security conferences in Russia, and the company was the major sponsor
 of the Russian information security forum held in Beijing in October.

“Huawei is essentially an arm of the Chinese state, whoever nominally owns it
,” said Gordon Chang, author of The Coming Collapse of China. “Its origins a
re murky, its growth far too fast for a private company in China, state offici
als support its efforts, and the absence of competition from state enterprises
 is another important tell.”

The Russians apparently see no other option than to invite Chinese heavyweight
s into the heart of its IT strategy. “China remains our only serious ‘ally’
, including in the IT sector,” said a source in the Russian information techn
ology industry, adding that despite hopes that Russian manufacturers would fil
l the void created by sanctions “we are in fact actively switching to Chinese
”.

In Russia, the strategy for greater collaboration with China has been develope
d and promoted by top-level Kremlin officials, generals and businessmen. These
 include Patrushev, Shchyogolev and Konstantin Malofeev, the billionaire found
er of Orthodox channel Tsargrad TV who is the subject of EU sanctions for his
connections to separatists in Ukraine. The group is believed to be the driving
 force behind Yarovaya’s law.

On 7 November, China adopted a controversial cybersecurity law that revived in
ternational concerns about censorship in the country. In a sign that collabora
tion between the countries is mutually beneficial, the legislation echoes Russ
ia’s rules on data localisation and requires “critical information infrastru
cture operators” to be stored domestically – the law LinkedIn fell foul of.
It seems the exchange of ideas has already borne fruit.

沒想到中國的長城防火牆也能外銷…
還好去年去俄羅斯的時候FB, Line, Google都還沒鎖…
不知道下一個外銷的國家會是哪裡…
